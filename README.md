# FAQ

## Can I use the plugin for my dashboard in production?

This gallery is primarily meant to be used as a starting point for you to develop your own plugins or to see what
plugins are capable of in general. You should be able to use these plugins in production, but before doing so,
make sure to read the plugin's README.md file. You might want to run it by your security team to ensure the
plugin you've chosen adhere to your company's security requirements.

## I have a nice plugin for this gallery. Can I share it here?

Sure, any contributions are welcome. Just fork the repo and make a pull request.

While creating a `README.md` file for the new example plugin, add a screenshot of the plugin result into the description of
the plugin. The screenshot should contain the whole dashboard or its major part, so it is clear that the image is taken from 
our application. If you are not sure, check existing plugins `README.md` files and images in `assets` folder of each plugin.
